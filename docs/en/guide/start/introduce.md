# Introduction

**Laravel Generator** is a code generation tool based on [Laravel](https://laravel.com/), using **Vue 2 + Element UI** for frontend rendering. It comes with a built-in default code generator that allows you to quickly generate any code you need. Additionally, you can customize code templates to suit your projectâ€™s development needs, helping you rapidly implement related business logic.


## Why Choose Laravel Generator

Laravel Generator is designed around several core features:

- **Clean and beautiful interface**  
  Ensures ease of use and provides developers with a smooth development experience.

- **Powerful templating capabilities**  
  With code template management, you can easily reuse code snippets and render various custom components within templates.

- **Team collaboration features**  
  Supports internationalization, template management, database migrations, generation logs, and more.

- **Extensibility**  
  Built-in custom rules and an online editor allow for defining various rules and template functions.


### Team Collaboration

As projects grow larger and more team members get involved, inconsistency in development standards can become a pain point. This inconsistency can negatively impact the development experience, and over time, the problem tends to worsen.

This led us to think: **Can we unify code style and enforce development standards from the start through technical reviews and code templates?**

We continued exploring this idea and ultimately achieved this goal with **Laravel Generator**.
